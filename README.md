Physics Simulator

Fall 2014
=================

We're going to (hopefully) get the project to a fully-functinal (though not fully-featured) state this semester.  It is getting late in the semester, but as long as everyone sticks with it, we can very reasonably finish before the end of the month.

Minimum Goals:
<ul>
<li>Create a pre-set collection of discrete point masses
<li>Draw the masses in 3D space
<li>Simulate the gravitational interactions between these masses in real-time
<li>Move around with-in the scene through keyboard and/or mouse driven "camera" controls
<li>Basic, completely elastic collisions regarding only the center of mass
</ul>
  
If the project moves along well or enough people express interest in contributing, I would like to add the following:
<ul>
<li>Support saving/loading the masses to/from a file
<li>Support directly manipulating the scene through the GUI
<li>More advanced collision: including geometry,  inelastic properties of the masses, potential absorption (deleting one of the masses)
</ul>
